this library contains interface to work with matricies, but only (NxN) matricies.
elements of the matrix could be integer or double type.
you could also enter the range of the elements.
functions in header "matrix.h" allow you to: 
- generate a random matrix with definite values range, 
- print matrix
- multiply one matrix whith another
there are two type of multiplication:
a) advanced in a single thread
b) multithreaded with the definite count of threads


How to use it:
1) create a directory(build)
2) in the directory(build) enter: cmake .. 'desired_path'=install (you could also use a cmake variable -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install)
3) then the command: cmake --build ..
4) finaly, enter the command: cmake --build . --target install

After all this steps there are directory install with subdirectories: include and lib 



template: cmake .. -D<library_name>_DIR=path_to_config_file.config
for use from other cpp files, need to clarify path to library config:
cmake .. -Dmatrix_lib_DIR=path_to_config_file.config
after that, cmake .. --build .
