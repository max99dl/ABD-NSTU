this library contains interface to work with matricies, but only (NxN) matricies.
elements of the matrix could be integer or double type.
you could also enter the range of the elements.
functions in header "matrix.h" allow you to: 
- generate a random matrix with definite values range, 
- print matrix
- multiply one matrix whith another
there are two type of multiplication:
a) advanced in a single thread
b) multithreaded with the definite count of threads
